CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net CLK100MHZ_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): CLK100MHZ_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-12#1 Warning
DSP input not registered  
DSP instance vga_controller/addra_reg is not fully pipelined on the input side. AREG/BREG/CREG/DREG are not used.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
